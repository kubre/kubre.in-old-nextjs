## Experience

You heard the greatness of TypeScript, maybe stumbled on it , maybe you saw the job posting for a typescript developer, or maybe you're just thinking to jump on hype train.

You know looked for tutorials and learnt basics like adding types, implicit types, interfaces and more. You start your new project in Typescript and suddenly it feels like you're writing too much boilerplate for same functionallity as javascript. IDE completing your code feels nice but is that worth all the boilerplate?
**NO**
But you don't have too.

## How do I start then?

Most important step is to just rename you'r <code>.js</code> file to <code>.ts</code> and start coding.

_That's it?_

**Yes!** You're done<sup>*</sup>. Ok we do have some other stuff to follow up we are not exactly a typescript developer now. Let's go with example to exactly understand what I'm talking about.

Here's an example with javascript. The `getPosts()` returns all posts and if provided a category returns filtered posts by category.
~~~js
const allPosts = [
  { title: "Post One", category: "one" },
  { title: "Post Two", category: "two" },
];

function getPosts(category) {
  if (category) {
    return allPosts.filter((post) => post.category === category);
  }
  return allPosts;
}

console.log("All:", getPosts());
console.log("Filtered:", getPosts("one"));
~~~

```bash
# Output
> node demo.js
All: [ { title: 'Post One', category: 'one' }, { title: 'Post Two', category: 'two' } ]
Filtered: [ { title: 'Post One', category: 'one' } ]
```

Works as expected.

Now let's get started with a typescript example. Beacuse typescript doesn't run on browser. Let's initialize a typescript 

```bash
# Install typescript
> npm install typescript --save-dev

# Initialize typescript
> npx tsc --init
```

Once Initialized you will see the new tsconfig.json file appear. We can leave it on default for now.


This works fine, but we want typescript. Let's rename file to `demo.ts`. If 

So let's say you've file with above function

export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout meta={{
  title: "⏰ From Javascript to Typescript in 5 minutes",
  description: "",
  published_at: new Date("27 Jun 2022"),
  keywords: ["javascript", "typescript", "leanring"]
}}>{children}</PostLayout>;
